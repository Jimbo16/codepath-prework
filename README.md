## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
The list of the apps that I like are:
Example App: **Snapchat**
-It's able to notify you if a screenshot is taken.
-It has map which is used to share locations with friends.
-I like the fact that you can choose who to share your location with.

Example App: **Dominos App**
-I like the fact that you are able to track the status of your order 
-I like the fact that it keeps records of all your previous orders(This is done by almost all apps).

Example App: **Instagram**
-I like the fact that you can unsend messages without the other person realising
-I like the fact that it can suggest the people you are supposed to follow basing on your contacts.

I would like to build an app which helps to detect certain diseases in plants. For example in potatoes, the app would help to detect potato virus y (PVY). And this would be done by scanning the leaves of the potato plant.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
